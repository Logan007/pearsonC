# Pearson CRC32c Hashing

As [discussed](https://github.com/skeeto/hash-prospector/pull/13#issuecomment-977186194) over at Skeeto's [Hash Prospector](https://github.com/skeeto/hash-prospector), a CRC32c-MUL-CRC32c scheme seemingly forms a low-bias permutation on 32-bit values. Embedding it into a Pearson scheme as used with [Pearson B. Hashing](https://github.com/Logan007/pearsonB), we get a new hashing function. Following the naming series, let's call it **Pearson C. Hashing**.

Hope is that the CRC32c instruction as found at Intel comptaible CPU's starting with SSE 4.2 support will accelerate hashing a lot.

## Permutation

We use an all-same constant version as it has a comparable bias to an all-different constant version. This way, we might save some cycles loading constants from cahce or memory. 

```
uint32_t cmc (uint32_t x) {
    
    x = _mm_crc32_u32(x, 0x941325ab);
    x *= 0x941325ab;
    x = _mm_crc32_u32(x, 0x941325ab);
    
    return x;
}
```

This scheme passes SmallCrunch (15/15), masters Crunch (140/144) and does well on BigCrush (141/160).

### Further Steps

A few tests are still missing such as the comprehensive evaluation of SMHasher â€“ to follow soon. Same for the full C implementation.
